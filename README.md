# Project 1: Early Prevention of Diabetes using Explainable ML (Python)

Objective: The project applied Python and Explainable AI (XAI) techniques, including SHAP and LIME, to identify key indicators for early detection of diabetes. A comparative analysis of various supervised learning algorithms—using scikit-learn library to perform such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Logistic Regression—was conducted to determine the most effective models for predicting early-stage diabetes. Model performance was evaluated using metrics like F1-score and ROC-AUC to ensure robustness and reliability.

Learning Outcome: The black-box nature of traditional supervised learning models can hinder their interpretability, especially in critical healthcare applications. By integrating XAI techniques, such as SHAP and LIME, this project enabled better transparency in the decision-making process. 

This not only provided more actionable insights for physicians but also empowered them to initiate early prevention strategies for patients, ultimately improving patient outcomes and fostering more informed clinical decisions.
